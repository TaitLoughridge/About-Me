    <p>
        I have an art degree from the University of Houston. My plan was to be an art teacher but that turned into a job with an oil and gas company before I even finished my degree. I still pursue my love of art today, just more as a hobby. (The image above is a bust I made and my self while taking a workshop at the MFAH Glassell School of Art)
    </p>

    <p>
        I have worked in oil and gas for over two years, but after getting laid off due to COVID I decided to make the switch to something more stable. My husband completed the flex program last year and has been encouraging me to do the same.
